<p class="smcap">My Dear Father and Mother:</p>

<p>No word, no act, no consecrated gift of mine, how great or slight
soever it may be, can ever repay the beneficence and love of you to
whom I owe life and whatever of prosperity has been granted me.</p>

<p>As my eyes glance in retrospect along the fading perspective of years
and lose themselves in the dim days of the cradle, and thence to the
present look forwards to the distant peaks of hope that rise above
unknown mists and shadows and horizons, I hear the counseling words
of a father, and feel the ever-present touch of a mother’s hand, as
both guide me with love into the dim unknown of life. Though I pass
onwards with a father’s “God-speed,” and a mother’s lingering embrace
and loving kiss, and leave you both fondly looking after me, still your
presence in my memory is ever a guiding reality that even now directs
this good right hand of mine to inscribe these dedicatory words of
filial affection.</p>

<p>If in the days agone I ever seemed unheeding of that counsel of
a father, and unmindful of that dearest love of a cherished and
cherishing mother, I can but say that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span> both that counsel and that love
reach through those moulding and shaping years of my life and take hold
on my heart with a firmness and a gentleness that nothing else of all
the years can boast.</p>

<p>It is but right and just, therefore, that in these your later days
I should likewise be your guide and your stay in so far as my hand
may let;&mdash;that I should reach out my strong young arm and steady the
tottering years that throng around you.</p>

<p>Withal, if I can afford you even one slight pleasure, it is my heart’s
desire so to do. It is, therefore, with somewhat more than filial love
that I dedicate this little volume to you, my Father and my Mother,
both together my counselor and guide, still mercifully spared to your
children; and in doing so, I can but express the hope that your years
may yet be many and happy; that the iris struck by a New Sun from the
crystals of the whitened and whitening wintry years may be as full of
beauty and joy as were the early spring blossoms of love and hope that
you pressed to your bosoms in youth.</p>

<p class="r4">Your Son,</p>

<p class="r1">CHARLES.</p>

<h2>BY THE WAY.</h2>


<p>As the presentation of these collected verses in their present printed
form has been induced largely by the request of many of my former
college students and by the importunities of my most intimate friends,
and as this volume has consequently been prepared chiefly for their
pleasure, it is hoped that those into whose hands the book may fall
are already so well acquainted with the author that the selections
themselves need no formal introduction to make them agreeable company
and engaging companions.</p>

<p>In justice, I should here say that this collection contains only a
few out of the vast number of good, bad, and indifferent pieces of
verse that I have been making at odd hours of a busy life, ever since
my boyhood, for my own pastime, pleasure, and literary and linguistic
improvement, with no thought nor distant dream of ever permitting them
thus to invade the domains of the sovereign public.</p>

<p>That the little book that thus modestly goes forth will attain either
a large circulation or great popularity I neither expect, nor attempt
to bring about; but that men and women with hearts that love and souls
that look above may find much quiet pleasure and satisfaction in the
following pages I do sincerely hope.</p>

<p>It is neither my desire nor befitting to my work to lay claim to
any degree of excellence in the verses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span> herein presented. Quite to
the contrary, I see and regret many defects which I can now neither
remove nor repair. But, however defective they may be in form or in
spirit, I have ever thought that little else than the interpretation
of the relations of the human soul to life, here and hereafter, and
the presentation of the good, the beautiful, and the true of the human
heart is worthy of serious effort.</p>

<p>As a consequence, most of these pieces are dual in meaning&mdash;one, in
plain view, the reality; the other, less distinct, the finer ideality,
the reflection, or mirrored image of the first.</p>

<p>It is this second, this finer and often, at first, obscure meaning
that, in my judgment, is the essential&mdash;the preserving salt&mdash;of any
poem. Certainly if not this meaning but the apparent one, the one on
the surface, is the basis of judgment on these poems, they will fall
far below the estimate accorded that poetry which is deemed worthy of
existence.</p>

<p>I wish here to return my thanks for the hearty reception accorded the
few selections of the prospectus, and to express the hope that the
completed volume will equal whatever expectations the recipients of the
prospectus may have.</p>

<p>Also, I cannot pass without noting the fact that a large share of the
first edition of this volume was engaged nearly six months before it
went to press, even before I had determined what productions I should
use, and that, too, upon the mere announcement that the publication was
contemplated for the present summer.</p>

<p>I wish, therefore, thus publicly to thank those who have given this
substantial earnest of their appreciation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></p>

<p>Any opinion or criticism, favorable or unfavorable, or any suggestion
or correction on thought, arrangement, typography, or other point, that
the reader may see fit to express, is not only invited and encouraged,
but will be most gratefully received and carefully considered.</p>

<p>One word more. If a selection will not bear a second reading, or a
third, a fourth, or a fiftieth reading; if it does not grow better and
better at each reading; if it does not lift the soul to a higher plane,
a nobler aim, a purer life, and a grander view; if at each successive
reading something does not come out of it and enter the heart, and
then pass back into the poem again, and thus again and again, each
beautifying and ennobling the other, like a sunset halo among the
clouds and the liquid, translucent image thereof in the mirroring lake,
then it is no true poem, and should be cast aside.</p>

<p>The only proof of the excellence of a poem is that it makes the heart
larger and the soul nobler for having read it, and that at each
successive reading both the poem and the reader grow better and better.</p>

<p>Believing, as I do, that poetry is nothing less than the interpretation
of the Divine in the human heart (whether in the mood of tears or of
laughter), I can but hope, in entrusting these “children of the brain”
to the care of others, that in the heart of each little waif some good
may be found, some song may be heard, some beauty be revealed, some
experience be verified.</p>

<h4>SYMBOLS IN SONNETS OF LIFE.</h4>

<p class="sm">On submitting this poem to critics, I find that various ideas are
gleaned. Some take it as a literal description of night and day, or
light and darkness! Others think that it celebrates the victory of
truth over error, right over wrong, virtue over vice, or possibly the
triumph of learning over ignorance, or civilization over barbarism.
This is not so surprising; for I confess it does, indeed, admit
various interpretations. Some say that in its obscurity, though in
nothing else, it somewhat resembles the work of some great poet.
The only consolation that I can squeeze out of all these various
opinions is that obscurity and occultness synchronously attend upon
and are concomitant with both iconographic delineations and symbolical
phraseology. ’Tis <i>said</i> ’tis so,&mdash;and so ’tis sad!</p>

<p class="sm">“Sing a song o’ six-pence, pocket full of rye, four and twenty
black-birds baked in a pie,” etc., is comparatively meaningless, tho’
pleasing, unless we know what is symbolized. The “pie” is the <i>day</i>,
the “four and twenty black-birds” are the twenty-four <i>hours</i> of the
<i>day</i>, etc., etc. The symbols thus completed give a new beauty to that
old jingle. In fact, it was that identical jingle with its symbols that
suggested <i>Sonnets of Life</i>.</p>

<p class="sm">As the title and staring Carlylean capitals throughout suggest, I
intended this poem to be a sort of <i>Analogue of Life</i>. In consequence
of all the foregoing, and for the delectation of those who care to read
the piece a second time, I have subjoined these</p>

<h5><i>Symbols and Notes.</i></h5>

<p class="center p-left sm">I.</p>

<ul class="sm">
  <li><i>Darkness</i>,&mdash;death.</li>
  <li><i>Light</i>,&mdash;life (on earth).</li>
  <li><i>day</i>,&mdash;one’s duration of life.</li>
  <li><i>Sun</i>,&mdash;one’s life.</li>
  <li><i>black’ning height</i>,&mdash;hour of death.</li>
  <li><i>quiver of the planets</i>,&mdash;thoughts, desires, longings, hopes.</li>
  <li><i>arrows</i>,&mdash;faith in the future.</li>
  <li><i>iron-plated breast of Night</i>,&mdash;gloom of one’s death.</li>
  <li class="hangingindent1"><i>streams of living blood</i>,&mdash;hope others receive from the Christian’s death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></li>
  <li><i>dire</i>,&mdash;i. e., <i>dire</i> only to Darkness.</li>
  <li><i>sorrowing sea</i>,&mdash;sorrowing friends.</li>
  <li class="hangingindent2"><i>skyed in the doming flood</i>,&mdash;acts, deeds, words, hopes, etc.,
of the dead, reflected in humanity and especially in the hearts of friends.</li>
</ul>

<p class="center p-left sm">II.</p>

<ul class="sm">
  <li><i>Reviving Sun</i>,&mdash;soul, on morning of resurrection.</li>
  <li><i>eastern gray</i>,&mdash;dawning of the morning of the resurrection day.</li>
  <li><i>mail of Night</i>,&mdash;sleep of death.</li>
  <li class="hangingindent3"><i>Last sonnet</i> closes all life on earth, triumphs over death, and brings the resurrection day.</li>
  <li><i>Last two lines</i> begin and indefinitely extend the Life Eternal.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p class="sm">This may aid somewhat. Too close an interpretation cannot be permitted
in any poem: ’twould make some of the most exquisite poetic thought of
literature ridiculous and nonsensical. The true poetic nature never
needs more in the interpretation of any poem than the title and the
naked poem itself to <i>suggest</i> thoughts and images infinitely more
beautiful than explanation can possibly make them.</p></blockquote>

<h3 class="larger">FAMILY OF THE EPHEMERA.</h3>

<p class="center p-left smaller">(To be read in connection with the following poem, “Shut In.”)</p>

<p>Somewhere, sometime, I know not when or where, I have heard a strangely
beautiful and beautifully strange and altogether wonderful story&mdash;a
story of a pygmy people.</p>

<p>In the long, long ago that has slipped into the lethal tide of the flow
of Time where even the years have forgotten the rolling chime that
they used to sing to the shore of a heavenly clime (and where poets
don’t ever, nor ever, nor ever rhyme), whence even Tradition, asleep,
forgets to climb, so long ago that I don’t know but that the time still
antedates all dates, there lived the Family of the Ephemera.</p>

<p>As the sun came up in the morning, the race came into existence.
During the night, a toad-stool of wonderful dimensions had sprung up,
and beneath this over-shadowing phenomenon, built by the genii of
darkness, the first glint of the new day’s sun kissed the first born of
a new race&mdash;the Adam and Eve of the Family called Ephemera.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>As the sun arose, and ere, e’en years ere it showed its lower disk,
the family increased most startingly. The whole of their known world
was peopled. They developed the resources of their vast little land.
They cultivated the soil. They delved in the mines for gold. They
carried on commerce with their widely scattered selves. They built
homes and cities. Their cities were magnificent, their houses built of
exquisitely carved and polished stone quarried from a grain of sand.
Each window was made of the filmy iridescence of a single sunbeam, and
curtained with richly embroidered tapestries woven from threads of the
delicate shadow cast by a single ray of spectral purple. Their tables
were filled with all the rich and dainty micros of the land. Withal,
they were a happy, though barbarous people.</p>

<p>The sun arose. Men of the present generation had already grown
gray-headed, while myriads of their posterity were just starting on
their paths. Generation after generation had already come and gone,
each leaving the wealth of its history, its experience, its scientific
researches, its learning to the inheritants of the next.</p>

<p>Centuries to them came and went, governments grew old, decayed, and
passed into tradition, while others sprang up in their places;&mdash;for to
this strange and fast-living people, our moments were days, our seconds
were months, our minutes were years, our hours were centuries, and our
days were ages untold that lap the two ends of time into one unbroken
eternity.</p>

<p>The sun was mid-forenoon. The Family of the Ephemera had grown old
and wise. They pointed with vaunting pride to their intelligence and
prosperity, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span> their grand achievements reaching down the long,
fretted colonnades of history and vanishing in the dim perspective of
tradition’s mystery. They looked upon all around, beneath, and above
them, and rejoiced that all was for them. Their wise philosophers
pointed to the sun and said, “All for us!” They told and taught how
that great sun had always remained in its present place; for even in
the memory of the oldest inhabitants no one had ever known the sun to
be in other place than now. Nay, even history knew it not. They said,
however, that there was a tradition, but not authenticated by history
nor by later scientific investigation, that the sun long, long æons ago
had occupied a position nearer the horizon. They showed how and why
all things were made for them; how the great toad-stool, towering an
immeasurable distance above them, had been placed on earth for them,
and them alone, and philosophized how it was impossible for another
to exist in the universe. They rejoiced that their little world was
created, and endowed with all its richest blessings, for none other
than them. They were a happy people, and prosperous. Their want of
wisdom made them more happy and more prosperous.</p>

<p>Centuries came and went. The sun stood in the zenith. So stood the
race of Ephemera. Wiser philosophers than those of the mid-forenoon
of their existence still pointed toward the great red sun, and said,
“It was always <i>there</i>; it was made for <i>us</i>!” Crowns crumbled. New
nations arose as from chaos, flourished, and died. Others took their
places. Schools had always been tolerated. They were now fostered. They
pointed their telescopes toward the mighty fret-work of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> the toad-stool
above them, and computed the number of huge radial beams that supported
its broad outer rim. The students of the universities and colleges
delved deep into the lore of their ancestral nations. They studied
history; they read their poets; they reasoned and computed with their
mathematicians; they looked down into the earth and up into the heavens
with their philosophers, and, withdrawing to their own narrow cells,
they said, “All for us, all for us!”</p>

<p>The sun passed the zenith, declining to the west. The race declined!
Still, philosophers said, pointing to the sun, “’Twas alway thus; ’twas
made for us!”</p>

<p>They said Time was for them, and them alone. They could not conceive
another similar or a different people. With prophecy, they looked into
the future. They claimed that, also: for a hope and a faith, placed
in their hearts at their creation, had grown and strengthened, that
they should all meet again in another world, a brighter and a better
world, all for them, all for them. The gods, with whom they peopled all
things, watched over and guarded them, and them alone.</p>

<p>The sun sank low. The lower limb touched the horizon. With the going
down of the sun, the race decayed in its old age. As the last ray of
sun passed over the land of the Ephemera, only two of this strange
Family, wandering hand in hand, old and lone, turned their eyes to the
waning light of the west, and sank to rest as the ray shot up and out
into the unfathomed sky beyond, and glinted its gold on the clinking
stars, the beautiful golden gates of the sable and iron-bound night!</p>

<p>Thus passed away the Family of the Ephemera. Strange, strange story!
A race wrapped up in them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>selves, never dreaming that there might be
innumerable other realms like their little own; that there might be
peoples on peoples beyond their ken in worlds unknown as superior to
them as the gods of Olympus were superior to the Romans.</p>

<p>A strange, strange story!&mdash;for we are looking through an inverted
microscope, the large end at the eye, and the small end turned upon
Time, Events, and the Human race!</p>

pleasing scent of the roses of recollection, intoxicating even

<h3>WHAT IS POETRY?</h3>


<p>Proper conception and appreciation of the poetic, whether in objects
of nature or in the mirror of words reflecting the human heart,
presupposes a delicate and divinely wrought nature tuned to the touch
of the Maker’s hand. Only such a beauty-loving soul finds responsive
a chord to the soul of beauty that dwells in the bodying words of
poetry. The finer the soul, the finer the music. To possess this
light-receiving and radiant Divinity is to possess at once both the
highest attainment of human culture and aspiration and the greatest
gift of God. It is thus at the same time both a growing seed and the
seed’s growth. That is, the poetic soul is both a gift divine and
a cultivation of it consecrated to the Divine Giver. Or, in other
words, the poet is both born and made. <i>Poeta nascitur non fit</i>&mdash;the
poet is born, not made&mdash;is true in this sense and in no other; for
the feelings, the gifts of the poet, are the gifts of every human
soul in greater or less degree. Else the proverb is not true, and we
must say, <i>Poeta nascitur et fit</i>; which would, no doubt, be equally
misunderstood. But <i>Poeta nascitur non fit</i> is true; and if, instead of
being translated literally, it is rendered in an explanatory way, it
means simply:&mdash;“The poet possesses the same faculties that others do;
but the poetic faculty in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span> him at birth is more highly developed than
it is in others, and is consequently susceptible of a higher degree of
cultivation. If the poetic faculty is naturally slight or insignificant
at birth, no amount of cultivating and polishing can create, or make,
a poet of its possessor.” This is the ancient meaning, and the only
sensible meaning, the meaning accepted by all who understand the
subject.</p>

<p>To see it from a different angle. The true poet has both genius
and talent&mdash;or rather, genius has the poet and compels the poet to
have talent. Genius is the divine gift; talent is the cultivation.
Genius&mdash;poetic genius&mdash;, the highest harmonious union of the feelings,
is the part of the poet that is born; talent, the ability to reveal
that genius, is the part that is cultivated, or made. Genius is power;
talent is skill. The man of poetic genius cannot help writing; the man
of poetic talent can help it, but won’t. That’s the main difference.</p>

<p>If you can’t help writing, nine chances out of nine you are a poet,
and are unconscious of your great power from the simple fact that it
is natural to you. If you can help writing, don’t write; for you are
evidently no poet, though you may have talent, and may believe (very
likely will) from the unnaturalness of it that you are great.</p>

<p>The genius which forces the poet to write is the same genius that is
ever reaching out of the poem and beckoning us upwards. Thus much for
the present as to what constitutes the poet.</p>

<p>Now as to poetry. Though we cannot hope to arrive at the seat of its
mysterious fountain of inspiration and bind its hidden springs of
immortality, we shall nevertheless, in earnest search, by upward,
honest, toilsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span> flight, at least behold the beauty-embodying mountain
heights whence its rivers of eternal glory flow, and whither the soul
must ever soar to drink of its purest living waters;&mdash;waters that
purify mortality and reflect Divinity, and make the soul bathed in
them and drunken of them better know its own vastness, grandeur, and
divinity.</p>

<p>Until the soul by this upward flight shall have beheld itself thus
divinely reflected in the immortal streams of poetry, it can never feel
and know its own vastness, its infinitude. Likewise, until it shall
have bathed in and drunk of these mighty purifying waters of goodness,
truth, and beauty, the soul can never know the divinity and immortality
of poetry. Thus, if the soul know not the one, it cannot know the
other; the two knowledges are reciprocal.</p>

<p>It may be said æsthetically and as nearly scientifically as it can well
be said, that poetry is naturally rhythmical and metrical imaginative
language interpreting the Divine in the human heart. This defines at
once, as nearly as can well be defined in a single sentence, the Form
(or mechanism), the Spirit, and the Mission of poetry.</p>

<p>Form we can define and anatomize, just as we can define and anatomize
the human body. The spirit of poetry we cannot define and anatomize,
just as we cannot define and anatomize the human soul. Form alone
cannot constitute a poem, just as body alone cannot constitute a man.
Spirit alone may constitute poetry (in the abstract) though not a
concrete poem, just as the soul alone may constitute life though not a
living man. Just as both body and soul are necessary to constitute a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
man, so also both form and spirit are necessary to constitute any of
his visible art-creations, as a poem.</p>


<h4 class="smaller">FORM.</h4>

<p>The requisites of form are rhythm and metre. The accidents of form are
rhyme (consonance), assonance, stanza, alliteration, onomatopœia, etc.,
etc.</p>

<p>Rhythm has to do with the kind of feet in a line, while metre has to do
with the number of feet in a line. Rhythm corresponds with the regular
rise and fall of the waves of the sea, each wave-length being counted
a poetic foot. Metre corresponds with the swell of the sea, composed
of several successive waves. Thus metre is, after all, a kind of
rhythm,&mdash;the larger ebb and flow of rhythm.</p>

<p>The accidents of form, such as rhyme, stanza, alliteration, etc.,
we find worthily and advantageously used in much true poetry,
as well as worthlessly used in the tawdry puppet-shows of mere
mechanicians;&mdash;those persons who, having nothing to say, yet attempting
to say something, mistake rhyme for sense, a tickling jingle for
meaning, their desire to create for the creative power. They do not
rightly read nor well heed the trite epigrammatic precept, “When you
have nothing to say, say it.”</p>

<p>But these accidents of form, I say, are sometimes material aids to the
thought; indeed, always are when used not for their own sakes but for
the meaning’s sake. Notwithstanding this fact, many of our greatest
poems, such as Paradise Lost and others on the epic order, as well as
many not epic, lack these accidents either wholly or in part.</p>

<p>On the other hand, rhythm and metre are found in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span> poetic forms, and
are the only two elements of the form of poetry that are thus found.
Hence, rhythm and metre are not only essentials but they are the only
essentials of form, and constitute the complete body in which the
spirit of poetry naturally and inevitably clothes itself. They are,
therefore, just as necessary to poetry in its concrete or visible forms
as the spirit is.</p>

<p>But since rhythm and metre are thus essential to a poem, it is the
common custom to call anything poetry that has this external appearance
of the poetic.</p>

<p>This is a misapplication of terms. There is so much trash masquerading
in the poetic garb that this misapplication inevitably throws ridicule
upon true poetry.</p>

<p>Rhythm, when carried to excess and when used not for the meaning’s
sake, the feeling’s sake, but for the rhythm’s sake alone, becomes
simply jingle; quite invariably a rhyming jingle at that.</p>

<p>Metre, in company with rhythm and rhyme, is often diverted from its
true purpose and used solely to jiggle some fact or some epigram into
the memory, as illustrated by “Thirty days,” etc., and by all other
didactic metrical arrangements, as mentioned farther on.</p>

<p>But rhymes and jingles and metrical arrangements are not poetry. They
are simply members of the form, the dancing legs and arms of the
body, sometimes possessed of life with an indwelling guiding spirit,
and sometimes whittled out of wood and set in motion by an inspiring
string. These senseless puppets, or jumping-jacks, sometimes, indeed
often, tickle the mob by their lively antics; but the great final
judgment of humanity relegates them to the rubbish-heap and forgets
their ephemeral and unlovely existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>It is, I say, a misnomer to dignify such by the name of poetry. The
proper name is verse. Whatever is rhythmical and metrical, whether it
has any of the accidents of form or not, is verse. Hence, all poetry is
verse, but not all verse is poetry. Indeed, not one ten-thousandth part
of verse is poetry; for the requisite of verse is simply form,&mdash;the
body into which the spirit must enter ere it becomes poetry. To
illustrate,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="ileft">“Thirty days hath September,</div>
        <div>April, June, and November,” etc.,</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>has the form of poetry without the slightest touch of the poetic
spirit; thus constituting verse, simple and pure. It requires no
penetration to perceive that it is not poetry, though I doubt not that
nine hundred ninety-nine out of every thousand have called that stanza
in the usual loose way “a verse of poetry.”</p>

<p>But it is not only not poetry, but it is also not a verse, though it is
<i>verse</i>; for a verse is but one line of the poetic form, while <i>verse</i>
is the form itself. It is not poetry because it has merely form without
spirit. As well call the dead body a man (which indeed we sometimes do
in the same loose way) as call such by the name of poetry.</p>

<p>But the body of a man without the soul is a dead man; that is, not a
man at all. So also the body of one of his visible art-creations, as of
poetry, without the spirit, is dead art, a dead poem;&mdash;no poem at all.</p>

<p>Is it not so? Only look at our thousands of dailies, weeklies,
monthlies, quarterlies, and whatnotlies, where millions of these
poetry-bodies lie buried, smelling too much of mortality; then turn to
the time-glorified tomes of Chaucer, Shakespeare, Burns, Milton, Homer,
Virgil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span> and their eternal co-endurers for a breath of heaven. Let this
be the final answer.</p>

<p>Rhythm, it may be said (taking it beyond the realms of concrete
poetry), is the music of Nature. It is Nature’s natural expression, if
I may so speak. All her motions are rhythmical, have ripples and waves;
even at rest her forms lie in the rhythmic order.</p>

<p>Wherever billows beat the crags, or ripples kiss the sands; wherever
winds go soughing through the pines, or zephyrs toss a curl; wherever
snows may drive to drifts, or wheat-fields billow green and gold;
wherever drifting clouds, or dreaming skies, or bordering trees are
hung dependent on the smooth lake’s waters; wherever birds may sing,
or flowers bloom, or rivers run; wherever thunders wake, or hills and
valleys sleep;&mdash;there is rhythm, there is music, there is Nature’s
perfect harmony.</p>

<p>Nor is it different in man, Nature’s crown triumphant. In throes of
pain or woe’s distress; in joys that iris happy tears; in sorrow’s
mournful cadences; in laughter’s lilting melody; in peace and
bounteous plenty, or in war and woeful famine; in love or hate, or
life or death;&mdash;through all of man’s existence, there again is rhythm,
Passion’s only melody, the music of the soul.</p>

<p>True, in the calms of life, although ’tis there, we little feel this
rhythm,&mdash;this adjusting process by which man inevitably seeks to put
the heart in tune while here for higher harmonies hereafter. But when
the soul’s deep feeling is aroused, then listen to its rhythmic ebb and
flow like gently wimpling waters or like the surging beat, beat, beat
upon the sands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>Hear the lonesome cadences of sorrow crying up to heaven; listen to
the joyousness that tinkles through the melody of laughter; hark the
sharp, quick, fierce beat in the surge of righteous anger; hear the
tender, mellow music from the soothing lips of Love,&mdash;divine, immortal
Love&mdash;and dream of other worlds and better things as you listen thus
transported.</p>

<p>When these passions of the soul would express themselves in words,
the words, too, fashioned by the spirit that enters them, must
inevitably move in rhythm, and, in the greater wave-lengths, fit
themselves to metre. This feeling, or passion, that enters rhythmic
words&mdash;that unswervingly seeks rhythm as the only form in which it
can express itself&mdash;is the spirit of poetry. Thus it is that poetry
comes about; thus it is that poetry is spontaneous and not the result
of long meditation; thus it is that poetry is the natural outlet of
highly-wrought or great feeling.</p>


<h4 class="smaller">SPIRIT.</h4>

<p>As in man, so in all art of man, the soul within fashions the body
without. True beauty is soul-beauty; that beauty that is in the heart
and is felt by the heart, without which there can be no physical beauty.</p>

<p>Whatever in the world is beautiful, is beautiful just in proportion
to the beauty of the soul that sees it. Thus if we would find beauty,
we must first have it. The white-flecked blue of the skies of June;
the wren or peewee pouring fourth its perfume-drunken melodies from
among the apple-blossoms; the stretch of plain or towering height
of mountain; the scenes of hill or valley, wood or meadow, lake or
river; the Apollo Belvedere; the great Transfiguration; Paradise
Lost;&mdash;na<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>ture’s various forms and reproductions&mdash;have no beauty to
the heart whose cavities are empty. But to the full soul, the soul of
beauty, they are perpetual springs of life, where Divinity is ever
mirrored forth; for the soul gives what it gets, and gets what it
gives, and the getting is proportioned to the giving. Give, and we get;
keep, and we lose.</p>

<p>But what is it in an Apollo, a Transfiguration, a Paradise Lost that
feeds this soul-hunger; that possesses this beauty?&mdash;The marble of the
Apollo? Hard by lies the rough, unchiseled Parian marble; but it has
no beauty.&mdash;The painted canvas of the Transfiguration? Sitting before
it, there are yearly hundreds of canvases and brushes and paints and
paintings; but they lack the beauty.&mdash;The words, the rhythm, the metre,
the music of Paradise Lost? Millions of productions, from musty tomes
in the British Museum to the upper left-hand corner of the “patent
inside” of a newspaper, have all these; but no beauty.</p>

<p>What then? That same indefinable something which in man we call
the soul, and in art, the spirit; that which the admiring soul
instinctively feels and recognizes.</p>

<p>Had the sculptor never touched his chisel to the marble, nor the
painter his brush to the canvas, nor the poet his pen to the paper,
that same spirit, yet not bodied, would have existed within his own
soul, but never would have been beheld by others. To be seen by other
eyes, it must needs take on a visible body, a concrete form, in which
it shall dwell.</p>

<p>Thus all forms of Nature and all forms of Art, whatsoever, are the
mere bodying expressions of the spirit that inhabits them. Form is
necessary, but only as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span> medium through which the spirit may reveal
itself visibly.</p>

<p>The intuitive and unconscious recognition of this principle, that the
soul within fashions the body it inhabits,&mdash;the grandest principle of
all God’s great laws, the foundation of them all, illimitable as the
immortal Giver&mdash;is the door-way through which he who thus recognizes
must inevitably enter Nature and Art to enjoy the full communion of the
soul within, and to interpret the beauties of that soul’s divinity to
us.</p>

<p>He who thus enters is possessed of genius. In other words, he has a
great soul and lives close to Nature’s heart. We of lesser genius,
or of less loving souls (for a great soul is one that loves greatly)
commune with the indwelling spirit less freely. If we approach Nature
or Art consciously and try to unlock some side-door by the key of the
intellect, we shall probably find only cast-off garments; nay, many of
us may find that the door will not open and we must content ourselves
with a peep through the key-hole. Indeed, do not the multitude behold
the elegant structures of Nature and Art wonderingly for but a moment,
without even so much as attempting the key-hole, and then plod on,
unconscious that there is an indwelling soul that has thus fashioned
its earthly home?</p>

<p>This same great foundation-principle of Nature is likewise the
fundamental law of poetry and of all other art. For art, at best, is
nature wrought by man. What else can it be? It is fashioned by simply
a lesser Divinity, the soul of man, consequently less perfectly, and
follows the same law. Or better yet, art is nature wrought through the
instrumentality of man by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> great Divinity that works in him. Art
is simply a name used to designate a specific manifestation or kind
of nature;&mdash;that kind that comes through man, and has, not life, but
spirit; not life, but the picture, the show, the mirrored image of
life: a sort of record of the soul, and a lamp for its future guidance.</p>

<p>He who, by means of rhythmic words inspirited, can paint this picture,
represent this show, mirror this image of life, historicize this
record of the soul, light this lamp and hold it above the heads of the
trampling ages for the guidance of humanity, is the great poet.</p>

<p>Just in proportion to the greatness of such a soul will be the spirit
that imbues his creations. It cannot create a new form unless it first
implants some germ from its own spiritual self. Not only must there
be the spirit as the prime essential of poetry, the soul within that
fashions the rhythmical and metrical form it inhabits, but that spirit
must partake of that divinity that is in every human heart;&mdash;that
divine flower, deep-rooted in the soil of God, sometimes blossoming to
an angel-image, sometimes painting the glories of heaven on its petals,
sometimes breathing its deepest-drawn perfumes up from its muse-beloved
blooms to the throne above.</p>

<p>Would the soul create a statue, it must see “an angel in that marble”
ere it give the angel form; would it paint a picture, it must behold
within itself the transfiguration ere it live transfigured on the
canvas; would it write a poem, it must be a paradise of eternal love
and beauty ere it breathe immortal glory into words.</p>

<p>It is this soul within that comes out of the maker of the statue,
the maker of the picture, the maker of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span> melody, the maker of the
poem, and enters his creations, that distinguishes true art from mere
mechanism of art.</p>

<p>It is this same soul within that renders the artist, not a chiseler of
stone, a painter of canvas, a placer of notes, a rhymer of words, but a
maker, a creator, in his own lesser realm of nature.</p>

<p>It is this same intangible soul, just within yet just beyond the touch
of our finger-tips as we reach out farther and farther into the dim
unknown, this same indefinable spirit of beauty, shining through the
form that it inhabits, permeating it inscrutably, that somehow passes
out of the poem into the heart of the admirer, then slips out of his
heart into the poem again, and so on and on, again and again, ever
lifting the admiring soul as the poem itself is lifted higher still and
ever higher.</p>


<h4 class="smaller">MISSION.</h4>

<p>This practical age, “this nineteenth century with its knife and glass,”
ever botanizing and anatomizing, analyzing and scrutinizing in every
possible way, is constantly asking, “What is it good for?”; “Of what
use is it?” And whatever the knife and glass cannot explain to the
fact-loving intellect; whatever the age cannot thus analyze and convert
into ready cash or daily bread, it is wont to relegate to the Lethean
Limbo of Uselessness.&mdash;As if the mind of man were constituted of
intellect, pocket, and stomach, and whatever did not go to the filling
of these were useless.</p>

<p>It is well and just and right, indeed, that any age should thus
inquire, especially as to material things, so long as it does not dwarf
other faculties by giving all sustenance to one. To ask concerning
poetry, “What is it good for?”, “Of what use is it?”, is simply to ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
in a different form, “What is the soul good for?”; “Of what use is a
God!” There is nothing in God’s universe that does not have utility.</p>

<p>But to examine specifically and logically, and thus to discover
somewhat of the mission, the utility of poetry.</p>

<p>In order to do this, we must naturally refer to the human mind, since
thence poetry is brought forth and there it is perceived.</p>

<p>There are three great divisions of the mind; namely, Intellect,
Sensibilities, or Feelings, and Will.</p>

<p>The intellect is that power of the mind by which we think and know. The
sensibilities, or feelings, constitute that power of the mind by which
we feel. The will is that power of the mind by which we resolve to do
or not to do. These explanations are sufficient for our present purpose.</p>

<p>Therefore, whatever furnishes food for the intellect, the knowing-power
of the mind, must be of the nature of knowledge, didactic. Whatever
ministers to the feelings must waken emotion. Whatever gives action to
the will must rouse resolution.</p>

<p>All literature is for the mind. But since there are three departments
of the mind, and since literature is produced by and for the mind,
there must naturally be three divisions of literature that each
mental power may receive sustenance. That is, there should be that
literature for the intellect in which knowledge predominates. For
the sensibilities, there should be that literature in which feeling,
emotion, is the primary and essential element. For the will, there
should be that literature that has for its chief end the rousing of
resolution.</p>

<p>On examination of the literary products of the world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span> we find that
this philosophy is sustained. For the intellect, we have treatises (as
on the sciences, mathematics, etc.), histories, biographies, novels,
romances, essays, etc., etc. The primary object of these is to furnish
knowledge; to satisfy the intellect. They are in the highest sense
didactic, although, of course, just as the literature for each faculty
does, they incidentally furnish some food for the other powers.</p>

<p>This intellective literature is the kind that is most largely
cultivated at the present. In fact, it is cultivated almost to the
exclusion of the other two.</p>

<p>For the will, we have sermons, lectures, orations, speeches, addresses,
harangues, etc.; a class of literature that is small when compared with
the preceding. These two departments of the mind monopolize the whole
domain of prose.</p>

<p>That other department of literature, in which feeling is the dominating
and pervading principle, must, by its very nature, act upon that same
power of the mind that produced it; namely, the sensibilities.</p>

<p>Poetry is the literature of feeling, and consequently finds its
province here. It is the mission of poetry, therefore, as suggested
by the latter part of the definition, to minister to the feelings, to
interpret the Divine in the human heart. It is this that all writers on
the subject and that all poets mean when they say it is the mission of
poetry to give pleasure.</p>

<p>But what shall be the limit of that word “pleasure”? Herein lies the
chief cause of great differences of opinion, especially with those who
hold that there is such a thing as didactic poetry. Or rather, what
is the true meaning of “pleasure” as thus used? The very essence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span> of
pleasure, as opposed to pain, is that it gratify some emotion and set
it at perfect rest.</p>

<p>What emotions when gratified are at perfect rest? The answer at once
forces itself upon us, only the better emotions. That poetry does
minister to and satisfy the higher and nobler feelings, and that what
does not do this is not poetry, even the meanest heart that it touches
fully knows.</p>

<p>The attempted gratification of hate, or of any desire whatsoever to
give pain to any one, as illustrated in Pope’s <i>Dunciad</i>, Dryden’s
<i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>, Butler’s <i>Hudibras</i>, Byron’s <i>English Bards
and Scotch Reviewers</i>, and all such, never sets the mind of the writer
at rest, nor gives enjoyment to the reader. Indeed, who now ever reads
these, the world’s greatest illustrations of witty bitterness and
venom, couched in verse and unjustifiably designated as poetry?</p>

<p>These are accounted “great works.” But who, let me ask, ever reads any
of these “great works,” or ever heard of them, except in some text on
Literature? Or, having read them, who loves them, or their authors for
having written them? None. No, not one.</p>

<p>On the other hand, who has not read some of the noblest works of
Shakespeare, Burns, Milton, Tennyson, Longfellow, Bryant, Lowell,
Whittier, Holmes? And who does not feel nobler for having read, and who
does not hold these authors shrined in his heart of hearts for having
written? Is not this proof enough that it is the mission of poetry to
minister only to the higher emotions?</p>

<p>After all, hate is merely the negative of love; simply the absence of
the better emotion, a void, an ache, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span> pain. All attempts to gratify
it only make it stronger&mdash;or rather drive the better emotion farther
away&mdash;as illustrated by the cases of Pope, Dryden, Byron, and their
fellows in revenge and bitterness wherever we find them. No one ever
felt better or nobler or happier for gratifying a hate, for doing
a bad deed, or for giving pain to a fellow-mortal’s feelings. The
ever-accusing conscience, if he but listen, will never permit him to
say in his heart that such gratification has given him pleasure.</p>

<p>If, then, it is the mission of poetry to give pleasure, no matter
whether its interpretation of the Divine in the human heart be by tears
or by laughter, its ministration necessarily must be to the immortal
part of man.</p>

<p>In the light of all this, therefore, without further argument, it is
clear and conclusive that all verse that is sarcastic, satiric, etc.,
such as that of Swift, Butler, Pope, Gay, Prior, and their hosts, is
not poetry.</p>

<p>But what of the didactic? Whatever has the primary object of teaching
delivers its treasures to the keeping of the intellect. If, therefore,
verse aims primarily to teach, but ministers to the sensibilities only
incidentally, it is not true poetry. Poetry does not teach nor preach
nor argue nor discuss. Those are the provinces of prose. Poems and
roses must not teach; they must bloom. Their breath delights us, their
suggestions, their reflections of a Divinity that is above them, lifts
us&mdash;God knows why! The cry of pain, the romping laugh of children at
play, the pathos of death, the touch of the hand or the lips of the
one we love needs no argument to fill the heart with uncontrollable
emotion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span> These are the sweetest of the poet’s themes, and he has but
to reveal them without argument as they are experienced in the heart.
Argument kills them. Just in proportion to the didactic character of
verse the path of poetry is departed from, and the realm of prose
invaded. You cannot find a solitary purely didactic piece of verse the
meaning of which could not be better expressed in prose. Not so with
true poetry. That cannot be expressed in any other way.</p>

<p>The most illustrious types of the didactic are to be found in the
“Artificial School,” at the head of which stands Pope. When we cut out
the satiric and the sarcastic and all ill-feeling verse, as we see we
must, and then the didactic, as we are forced by reason and logic to
do, how much real poetry do we have left in this “School” so well named
“Artificial”? How much is there left that makes the heart feel larger,
nobler, better, and gives it new fountains of life? Only a rare gem
now and then in the form of a single felicitous line or happily wedded
couplet. Then, when we cut this same kind of verse out of the whole
literature of the world, and also that other kind, already spoken of at
length, in which there is merely spiritless poetic form as its chief
element, how much real poetry and how many real poets does the world
possess? Comparatively, only a few poets, the world’s great, and a few
of their works&mdash;those that have already stood the test of time and that
still stand the only true test of good literature, that it inspires the
heart with noble feelings and lofty purposes&mdash;can be placed in the list.</p>

<p>But enough on the kinds of verse.</p>

<p>Another question concerning pleasure arising from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span> poetry presents
itself. “Violent delights have violent ends and in their triumph
die.” The poetic, by its very nature, is violent. Consequently, the
mind cannot long imbibe its intoxicating draughts. A little at a
time is exhilarating and invigorating; but an over-dose deadens the
sensibilities, and often creates a serious dislike for the poetic and a
consequent unconscious restlessness of longing for the satisfaction of
the higher emotions that prose can never furnish.</p>

<p>The mind cannot long endure extreme exertion, just as the body cannot.
Poetry requires extreme exertion of the sensibilities, consequently
its duration should be short that its full delight and pleasure may be
enjoyed. Since this is so, every poem, by the very nature of the mind,
must be brief. Who would live in a conservatory of roses where their
sweet scent, most delightful at first breath, soon becomes sickening?
Or who would hold even one of those odorous blooms to the nose for
long? Who, on the other hand, does not delight in an occasional sip of
the scent of a bursting rose-bud? And who does not find new delight at
each successive draught, and regret that the petals that breathe this
odor for us, alas! must fade and fall?</p>

<p>I believe most profoundly with Poe that, from the standpoint of the
mind that produces and the mind that perceives and enjoys it, there is
no such thing as a long poem. I shall go farther, and say, not only
that a poem must be short, but that it must be lyrical. This gets us
back to nature. Historically the first literature of every nation is
poetry, and that poetry is invariably lyrical; indeed, even inevitably
so. In every nation, we find it is many centuries before these lyrics
of the nation are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span> gathered up and finally strung on the thread of
narrative, thus making the Epic. From the lyric, all imaginable forms
have been brought forth by ingenious poets of later day. The bard
of simple days lived, not close to nature’s intellect, but close to
nature’s heart. Burns was the best poet of modern days, because he did
the same; consequently, he is always lyrical when he is natural.</p>

<p>Shall we then say that the Æneid, the Odyssey, the Iliad, the
Canterbury Tales, the Faery Queen, or Paradise Lost is each one poem?
Viewed as I have just remarked, and that (in its relation to the mind)
is the only true way to view a poem, none of these is a single poem.
Each is made up of a number of poems&mdash;gems strung on the thread of a
common subject;&mdash;roses in a common conservatory.</p>

<p>Indeed, the whole of Homer is simply a collection of a great number
of short poems&mdash;lyrics, indeed, they were&mdash;sung by many authors for
centuries, and finally gathered up and pieced together to form books
and volumes. Each one of the Canterbury Tales contains many poems,
strung together to form one necklace of jewels.</p>

<p>I ask any one to sit down and read any of these great and wonderful
works continuously one day, as he might prose, and comprehend what he
is reading. Not even one book of Paradise Lost can be <i>read</i> (in the
true sense of that word) at a single sitting. There are too many poems
in it, and the consequent demands upon the mind are too great for that.
Possibly this very fact had somewhat to do with calling forth the
unjust remark from Waller concerning that great epic, “If its length be
not considered as a merit it hath no other.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Since a poem must be brief, naturally, and for the same cause, it
should be read judiciously and at intervals, if it is to be appreciated
and enjoyed, just as the rose must be smelled only occasionally. We
cannot read poetry as we can prose; it won’t let us. By their very
natures they demand a different manner of reading. One can read prose
continuously, hour after hour, without seriously wearying the mind,
for the simple reason that, in prose, thought is not condensed, but
is spread through a long series of sentences. Moreover, the thought
is not, as a rule, simply suggested, but is fully expressed, leaving
the mind in a comparative state of passive receptivity, with but
little active labor to perform in order to comprehend the meaning.
On the other hand, poetry always expresses thought in condensed form
and suggests many fold more than it expresses. Consequently, a single
stanza or even a single line may sometimes require as much attention
for the full comprehension of its meaning and suggestion, as a whole
page of ordinary prose.</p>

<p>We must plant the poem in the heart and give it time to grow, as we
plant the flower-seeds in the soil. Finally, as the growing flower
bursts into bloom, so must the poem blossom from the heart into its
full perfection and beauty.</p>

<p>Fully to appreciate that flower’s beauty, it must not be dissected and
analyzed by glass and scalpel. Did Burns go botanizing the daisy? Need
we then go botanizing these flowers and blossoms of the soul of man? He
who does it tries to force the intellect to do what the emotive nature,
the beauty-loving part of man, alone can do. There is an intellectual
delight in botanizing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span> and in picking to pieces and analyzing the
gathered specimens, but it is not that sweet, soul-inspiring pleasure
born of the love of the beautiful that the heart alone can feel. He who
botanizes the beautiful can never know in his head the supreme pleasure
that he who loves the simple daisy too well to turn it under the sod
feels in his heart.</p>

<p>Poetry is indeed immortal and divine. It is the breath of heaven in
the nostrils of man, the divinity of the human soul, the heart in full
flower and bloom. To an honest, earnest, sincere soul, it is the wonder
of the age, as it has ever been the wonder of all ages, that “men
endowed with highest gifts, the vision and the faculty divine,” being
divinely appointed as poet-priest of the Almighty, should pander to the
prurient taste of a so-called practical public;&mdash;that they should sell
the divinity within them for a strip of royal purple; for a salve to an
itching palm;&mdash;that they should barter immortality for a glitter-jingle.</p>

<p>But how shall this consummate artist not fall into the corruptions
that beset him and his art divine? Here are the driveling jinglers,
verse-makers, poetasters all about him, with their rattling,
rollicking, banging tin-panery, loudly applauded by a rough-and-ready
guffawing public; a “practical” public that loudly clamors for <i>sense</i>,
<i>fact</i>,&mdash;and then drops another penny into the chapeaux of these
venders of cheap jewelry for more of their applauded cheap sentiment
and glittering platitudes, and jingling chains and necklaces, and
rings, and things, whose brightness wears off in their mental pockets
before the wife or sweetheart is gladdened by a glimpse of its
“practical” glitter!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>The great, true poet, he who alone is interpreter of the immortal in
the mortal, the invisible in the visible by means of words, never asks
how to avoid these corruptions. He does it. He despises, hates, abhors
them. He does it, too, by obeying that Divinity within him. Obedient
to that call, he walks majestically through this motley crowd;&mdash;aye,
through this sometimes maudlin, jeering crowd that throw stones at him
and mentally would crucify him!&mdash;and sets some stream of Beauty and
Glory flowing through the hearts of men, forever to wash away these
corruptions and stagnations of the human soul. Aye, truly! he asks not
how, but teaches us how. Was it not so with those old Divine Writers,
our highest type of poets, whose inspirations make the one Immortal
Book? So shall it ever be. ’Tis the Divine Law.</p>

<p>Such a poet, interpreting nature and mirroring Divinity, and thus
idealizing life that the seeing, aspiring soul may attain nearer its
illimitable possibilities, we call an original poet, a genius. He is
never a “popular” poet, as that term is used, but he is quite generally
unpopular. Popular in the sense of time-enduring he is by that same
Divine Law that brings him into existence. His soul will inevitably
have some greatness in common with other great souls. These will rescue
him and commend him to an increasing posterity; and so on and on,
touching more and more souls, and thus seeming to grow ever better and
better, though in reality he remains ever unchanged, while the souls he
touches are the ones that ever strive to his greater height, and draw
up numbers with them.</p>

<p>Thus does he whom an unappreciating, small-souled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span> mob would have
crucified, become immortal through the reciprocal divinity that is
in himself and in the heart of humanity. Thus does, thus must, this
poet-genius create&mdash;call into activity&mdash;the taste that must make him
time-enduring. This is the penalty of genius and greatness&mdash;to suffer,
and then triumphantly to endure forever in the hearts of men. Who would
he were not a genius? Who would he were? In proof of all this, witness
Shakespeare, Milton, Wordsworth, not to speak of all the greatest Great.</p>

<p>I love that unswerving poetic genius who, in the face of taunts and
revilings and sneers, still is obedient to that sublime divinity within
him; who, conscious of his own soul’s illimitable vastness, must
inevitably write for that soul’s satisfaction, and thus write, not for
the present generation, but for posterity; and who, when he “wraps
the drapery of his couch about him,” having obeyed the divine voice
within him even to his latest breath, finally triumphs over all sneers
and taunts and jeers, triumphs even over death, and, though dead,
triumphantly lives in immortal words that still speak to us more and
more divinely through the trumpet-soul of the more and more divine ages.</p>

<p>Such a poet, I say, must create the taste that will make him
time-enduring. In other words, this true poet, this genius (else he
were no genius at all), must see some relation of soul to soul not
ordinarily seen, and never at all seen in exactly the same way, and
so express that relation in words that humanity can but recognize it
from the very fact of its commonness, its universality. Such a poet
never follows public opinion, in the narrow sense of the opinion of a
transitory present; but through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span> great trials and suffering and much
enduring generally, he leads it, or creates it rather, and develops it
into that broader, truer public opinion,&mdash;humanity’s opinion; the only
opinion, I should say, that is equal to that of a great soul.</p>

<p>The great never follow, but ever lead. They never pander to a perverted
public taste, but follow their own convictions; and thus following the
guiding power within them, they lead others in the same path. Thus
drawn onwards and upwards by that link which binds man unto God, and
thus leading humanity aright, they instinctively obey the teachings of
Him, the Master, who “came not to be ministered unto, but to minister”;
for they follow in His footsteps by upward leading and by thus greatly
and divinely serving mankind.</p>

<p>In a general way, I may say of poets that there are two classes:&mdash;the
introspective, or those whose souls, ever standing in the presence of
the Divinity within them, hear the calls of other souls and the mighty
voice of God; and hearing, obey;&mdash;the extrospective, or those whose
souls, not less divine, but less conscious, perhaps, of that Divinity,
unconsciously perceive the manifold relations in external nature, and
through the universal spirit of nature none the less distinctly hear
that same Almighty Voice. We shall hardly find a poet in whom one
of these characteristics exists to the exclusion of the other; but
we shall find that in many cases one characteristic or the other is
dominant. For example, Browning is one of our best representatives
of the introspective, and Wordsworth of the extrospective; while
Shakespeare is the highest type of the perfect union of the two. Both
classes obey the same voice, and though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span> ministering through different
sources, have the same mission to perform, the uplifting and purifying
of the human soul.</p>

<p>Indeed, whatever does not have this mission is not true poetry. It is
often said that that literature is best which has stood the test of
time. Not so, if by that is meant simply that the literature shall
have lived long; for both good and bad live. The true test is that it
betters man’s estate, and ennobles his heart. If a poem inspires the
heart with nobler feelings and greater love, then it is a good poem.
This is the crucial, the only true test.</p>

<p>There is no act of the human mind that is not controlled by the
feelings. When this is comprehended and when, at the same time, it
is perceived to what an extent poetry ministers to the feelings, the
utility of poetry will be better appreciated. Poetry thus ministering
to the controlling forces of life, is a guide and corrective of life;
a guide in that it is “a representation of life” (as Alfred Austin has
it), the experiences of the hearts of men; a corrective in that it is
“a criticism of life” (as Matthew Arnold says), an idealization that,
by uplifting, corrects the heart that else would droop. Austin thinks
his idea opposes Arnold’s. It does not. Each simply looks at one side;
each takes a different angle. Both are correct so far as they go. For
poetry is the heart’s history. It is also the ever present attempt, in
the light of that guiding lamp, to the making of a better history.</p>

<p>This, indeed, makes it philosophy. For what else does philosophy do?
The poet is ever a philosopher. Is not poetry philosophy teaching by
experience? It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span> does not teach by precept, it is not didactic; that
is the province of prose; but it mirrors the human heart and reveals
its experiences. Nine hundred ninety-nine people shape their lives
by experience where one shapes his by rule and thumb. One rose of
experience with its warning thorns has more of humanity and guidance
in it than all the tangle-woods of teaching. The hand must follow the
heart. If the heart be right the hand can never go wrong.</p>

<p>He who would be an immortal poet must have a great and sympathizing
heart; a heart that laughs and weeps, and most of all, a heart that
loves. Were I asked the one essential of the poet, that essential
which includes all minor requisites, I should answer, Love. “A Poet
without Love,” says Carlyle, “were a physical and a metaphysical
impossibility.” It is the dominating element of all great poets. What
poet is greater, or what one has loved more deeply than Burns?</p>

<p>Love often reveals itself in sorrow and in humor. Though the poet need
not be a humorist, must not be at all times, as the term is used, it
is nevertheless essential that he have a lively appreciation of the
ludicrous, lest he fall into grave errors of thought and expression.
But the humor must not be the all-pervading element of his poetry; it
should be simply a check, a guide, or sometimes a spur. A keen sense
of humor should be to him the lash that whips thought out of its
self-constituted morbid glooms, in which it appears ridiculous, into
a lively harmony with things as they really are to the hearts of men.
It were, indeed, a nice question to determine how far the grave or
the humorous should enter poetic composition to the exclusion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span> the
other. Certainly the most felicitous poetry is not all rain nor all
shine, but the iris of Ulloa struck out of the depths of tears by the
happy, hopeful shine of laughter.</p>

<p>But if the poet laugh, he must also love; for he laughs because he
loves. This is the divine law. The man who hates never laughs; he may
mock. Well may we ponder that. Indeed, tears and laughter, sometimes
blended, are but forms of love. If laughter is music, certainly love,
that divine gift in the human heart, love of the good, the beautiful,
and the true, love of home, of country, of mankind, of God, or of
a beautiful image of God, the one who is the heart’s ideal, divine
immortal love, is perfect harmony. If the poet’s theme is of the good,
the beautiful, and the true, so must his love be. If these dwell not in
his heart, he shall search the world and the ages through and not find
them; and if love dwell not there with them, his themes shall never
touch our hearts.</p>

<p>But the poet, to be appreciated, is not the only one that must possess
these qualities. It is the beauty and the love in the soul of him who
is touched by the statue, the painting, the melody, the poem, that
makes it beautiful to him. It is thus that we help the poet make the
poem. Love makes poets of us all.</p>

<p>With our hearts thus tuned to the touch of the Maker’s hand, we may
often hold sweet communion with our poet-friends whose love still
reaches out to us through the mists of ages and beckons us to the
Valhalla of the happy. We may stand alone in the stern, inquisitorial
presence of self under the eye of Almighty God, and think thoughts our
tongues can never tell.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[The willow-tree is emblematical of death, or forsaken
love&mdash;which, to the lover, is, of course, all the same
thing. The custom of a disappointed lover’s hanging his
harp on a willow-tree and going off to the wars in utter
desperation&mdash;hoping to get killed, perhaps, and thus be
revenged on his false sweetheart by making her <i>sorry</i>!&mdash;;
also the custom of wearing a green-willow garland about the
hat, and leaning up against the tree (they had no fences) to
die, somewhat <i>à la</i> Job’s turkey, I presume, as they used to
do before quicker, modern, new-fangled methods of a lover’s
getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span> out of the world came in; and the custom of doing
many other things that were done by the young ancient lovers,
is a custom that is dead. The preceding is the wail of one of
these youthful old dolorous fellows, in the English-Ballad
style of his day.]</p></blockquote>

<h3>THE TRANSFORMATION.<br />
<span class="subhed2">A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY.</span></h3>

<p class="p1">I am not superstitious, not in the least. But that certain things which
we cannot explain by any natural method may happen in the lives of us
all, there is no longer a shadow of a doubt in my own mind.</p>

<p>I had gone to bed as usual and had been sleeping soundly one night,
with only the faint glimmer of a sweet vision now and then flitting
through my mind, when suddenly I was startled from my sleep into a
lively consciousness of a strange presence, and weird, mournful sounds,
as of a dirge, in my room. Moreover, there was a peculiar sensation in
my head, a sensation that I have never before or since felt, a kind of
pain, yet not a pain; for in some indefinable way it was mysteriously
mingled with a peculiar, almost transporting rapture that seemed to
permeate my whole being. Indeed, the pain, starting immediately between
my brows and running back to my crown, seemed born of this pleasurable
sensation, which had no local residence but was in every nerve and
fibre, both together producing that indescribable exhilarating feeling
that I imagine the truly happy in the next world possess. But, you say,
surely the angels have no pain. I hope not; but this I have learned,
that every pleasure of earth has its pain. And as I cannot say that
this sensation was altogether that of a mortal, I cannot say from
experience that there is a pleasure without a pain.</p>

<p>For a moment after awaking, I could not tell where I was or what was
going on. But my senses being quickly roused to their fullest keenness,
I soon saw I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span> was in my own room. But the matter of the presence and
the weird sound was not so easily solved.</p>

<p>I lay quietly for a time, trying to persuade myself that I had been
dreaming and that my waking fancy was merely the hallucination of the
dream that had not yet passed away. Have you never done the like?
However, I soon realized that the presence and the sound, whoever or
whatever they were, were not mere fancy. Still I tried to shake off the
feeling that some one had entered my room; for, as is my custom, I had
securely barred the front door, also my bed-room door, before retiring.
Besides, no one could possibly have climbed in at my windows of the
second story without my knowing it; for when I am so nervous as I was
this night, the slightest sound will waken me. I turned over and looked
out of the window. The moon was still shining, and the trees swayed
with a soft murmur in answer to the light breeze that wantoned among
the virgin May leaves just lately from the bud. There were the houses,
the barns, the road, everything, in fact, just as it really was, and I
knew I could not possibly be asleep.</p>

<p>Still, that consciousness of a presence in my room, stronger and
stronger grown until it had reached conviction, I could not rid myself
of; nor could I shut my ears to the mournful sounds that came from
somewhere&mdash;everywhere, it seemed.</p>

<p>Suddenly&mdash;most wonderful to tell!&mdash;I saw the very faintest streak of
light creep up the farther wall of my room.</p>

<p>All that I have related did not, perhaps, occupy more than a full
minute, though I must confess it seemed much longer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>The thread of light, different from all lights I have ever before seen,
moved toward the ceiling rapidly, and held me in breathless attention.
What could it be!&mdash;A ray of the moon through a slit in the curtain that
was gently moved by the breeze blowing through the window? Wait! It
reached the ceiling. Then with such a delicate light that it was almost
imperceptible, it crept along the ceiling diagonally toward me. When it
got immediately above my head, it stopped. What in the world could it
be!</p>

<p>I lay almost breathless, wondering. Wouldn’t you, my friend, if you
should see such a thing in your room? You may not know what you would
do in such case. Possibly you say you would investigate at once. So,
too, had I said many a time,&mdash;I would investigate whatever was strange,
doubtful, or inexplicable. But if your hands would not move, if your
feet lay motionless, and if your whole being were thrilled with a
thralling rapture and pain all at once, you would probably do just as I
did,&mdash;lie there fascinated.</p>

<p>Suddenly, like a flash, something struck me on the forehead, and
instantly I sat bolt upright in bed. As I rose, whatever it was
that struck me bounded off on the bed, then down on the floor, that
mysterious filmy thread of light following it, and at the same time
clinging to my forehead. I put my hand up to brush it away. But when
I touched it (if I really did touch it, which I doubt, for my hand
seemed suddenly arrested), my whole body trembled as if shaken by some
supernatural power. It was something more than a light,&mdash;it was a film,
a thread; and at my touch upon it, that sensation of mingled pain and
rapture was almost be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>yond my power to survive. I let my hand drop
from it, and unable to resist doing what I did, I rose from my bed and
started to follow up that thread of light and film; for somehow it
seemed attached to my brain, and I involuntarily obeyed the will of
whoever or whatever it was that controlled it. Though fully conscious
of all I was doing, I could not resist. Great beads of sweat stood on
my body, caused partly, I suppose, by extreme nervous excitement and
partly by this influence upon me.</p>

<p>I would have hastened from the room, screamed for help, or cried
“murder!” but it was impossible. Even the rapidity of my steps was
under control, and I marched slowly, deliberately, and solemnly, as to
martial music of the dead.</p>

<p>I passed from my sleeping-room to my study, obedient to the slightest
inclination of the supernatural power that controlled the thread by
which I was led.</p>

<p>When I reached my study-chair at my desk, I obediently sat down. Then
for the first time I beheld the object that was exerting this power
over me. I have seen many an object before and since very similar to
it, but never at any time another just like it.</p>

<p>As I sat in my chair, my eyes riveted on the thread of light, suddenly
that object appeared at the other end of the thread on a pile of
blank writing paper that lay on my desk, and eyed me intently. I was
horrified, and if possible, less capable of resisting than before. What
I beheld, and what was exerting this supernatural influence over me was
nothing more nor less than a horrible, ugly spider!&mdash;a supernatural
spider, most certainly; different, I tell you, from any I have ever
before or since seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>As I sat watching the spider, it began moving up and down, back and
forth, and round and round on the paper in the most irregular motions
imaginable. Being rather large and clumsy-looking, his movements, so
very irregular though really not ungraceful, made the spider at first
look awkward.</p>

<p>Wonder upon wonder! As the spider began moving, another one, somewhat
smaller than the first, and more dimly seen, with even a finer thread
of light (attached, too, to the first spider’s thread), made its
appearance on another pile of paper. Could it be that a whole army of
spiders had convened to work my destruction, and that these two were
only the picket-guards? Yet it did seem that this one was not present,
but only the vision of a spider, existing somewhere in reality, but
present only to my mind. This, too, I am persuaded to believe, was
really the case. But the other one, the larger one, I swear was there
moving on my paper; and I still have the paper in my possession as
proof. As this one began to move, the visionary one also began to move;
as if each, unconscious of the acts of the other, was nevertheless
controlled by the action of the other, and the influence upon each
other was mutual. As they both moved, I noticed they left their
shining, filmy thread upon the paper. But I was so intent upon every
motion that I paid no attention to the web left behind, until each
spider, having almost reached the right-hand side of the paper, cut his
thread, went to the left, and began again to go through similar motions.</p>

<p>What could be the meaning of this mystic spider-dance? Such, indeed,
it now seemed to be; for my first impression of irregularity and
clumsiness had now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span> worn away, and their motions now seemed to be in
perfect unison, and measured with the grace and harmony of rhythm. The
room was but dimly lighted by the rays of moon that slipped in under
the curtains, yet I could see the spiders and their work plainly. I
glanced at the glowing web the first spider had left, and&mdash;wonderful to
relate!&mdash;as true as the sun shines above us, there at the top of the
page in writing that, had it been in ink, I would have sworn was my
own, the glowing web had been woven in and out so as to read, <i>Happy
Days of Yore!</i></p>

<p>Could it be possible?&mdash;was I not dreaming? I looked and read and read
and looked again and again. But there it was, plain as day, in a style
of writing, too, I say, that I would have sworn was my own had it been
in ink instead of woven in a glowing web. But why those words? Could
there be something in my life, past or present, that those words were
to taunt me about? My whole life’s history trailed before my eyes, a
galaxy of pleasant memories. No, nothing there that these words could
make regretful. Could it then portend something of a dark future? God
alone knows!</p>

<p>Thus meditating, my eye caught the less distinct glow of the web of the
other spider. Heavens! what next! There, as distinct as if written by
the hand of my old chum, were the words, <i>Memories of the Past</i>. Here
was a mystery growing deeper and deeper each moment. I would willingly
have taken my oath, and will to this day, that the handwriting was that
of my boyhood chum and present dear old friend.</p>

<p><i>Happy Days of Yore</i>,&mdash;<i>Memories of the Past</i>. How was I to solve
the mystery of the weaving of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span> words and fathom their intended
meaning? Both suggested to my mind a similar train of thought. But why
this mysterious writing?</p>

<p>As I sat thus meditating, I again became conscious of that weird
sound of which I have previously spoken, but which (my mind being so
preoccupied with what was before it) I had not again noticed until I
fell into this meditation.</p>

<p>It sounded like the sweet, sad blending of mournful voices singing,
or chanting, rather, to the deep tones of a distant organ. I recalled
myself and looked at the large spider, when I discovered that&mdash;mystery
of mysteries!&mdash;the echo-like organ voice and solemn chanting music
came from the spider alone as he moved across the paper, weaving his
golden web into rhythmic words! There, as the music went on, I read in
illuminated characters of the weaving spider’s web.&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Oh those happy days of yore</div>
        <div>Will come back to me no more!</div>
        <div>Ah no more, no more for aye!&mdash;</div>
        <div>They have fled with time away,</div>
        <div class="i1">And my heart is sad and lone</div>
        <div>As I dream forevermore,</div>
        <div class="i1">With a heaving sigh and groan,</div>
        <div>Of those happy days of yore.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Most wonderful!&mdash;wonderful not in the words so much, for they were
simple, plain, and as they moved to the music, graceful withal, seeming
to be words that might come from a sincere and true but untutored
poetic heart; wonderful, therefore, rather, that they should be woven
by a spider, and that, too, with a web of light.</p>

<p>As in eager wonder I leaned my ear closer, the vision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span> of the second
and more delicate spider, likewise weaving, passed before my eyes, and
I caught the distant strains of a deeper, sadder, sweeter melody, with
these words woven in the finer, more delicate thread of light.&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Oh how sweet those days of boyhood,</div>
        <div class="i1">Oh how dear those happy hours</div>
        <div>When I rambled through the forests</div>
        <div class="i1">’Mong the birds and trees and flowers!</div>
        <div>Life lay smiling all before me,</div>
        <div class="i1">No regrets, no cares behind;</div>
        <div>All the earth seemed bright with beauty,</div>
        <div class="i1">Life was freedom unconfined.</div>
        <div>I rejoiced whene’er the sunlight</div>
        <div class="i1">Scattered wide its golden beams,</div>
        <div>Thinking not that I should ever</div>
        <div class="i1">Miss its light or prize its gleams.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Still more wonderful and remarkable than anything before was the
similarity of music as well as of thought: more wonderful and more
remarkable because neither spider seemed conscious of the other’s
action or presence. Indeed, as I have already said, only one
really was present; the other existing in another place, and only
<i>psychologically</i> present to me. This latter fact, shown in all that
follows, I tell you, is the most remarkable psychological problem I
have ever met&mdash;except one!&mdash;nor have I ever yet found sage or savant
able to solve it. Many have tried it, wondered at it more and more as
they got more and more into its depths and subtle intricacies, and
finally in their weakness have given it up. Herbert Spencer, McCosh,
and other lesser philosophers cannot satisfy themselves upon it.</p>

<p>My interest was now, if possible, even greater than before. Again I
turned my attention to the present spider as in melody it wove.&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Oh those days of sweetest thought!</div>
        <div>Oh those days with rapture fraught!</div>
        <div>Had I known when but a child</div>
        <div>What great blessings round me smiled,</div>
        <div class="i1">With a wild, exulting leap</div>
        <div>I’d have struck on wisdom’s door;</div>
        <div class="i1">Piled up knowledge heap on heap</div>
        <div>In those happy days of yore.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Both were weaving rapidly, as if their very lives were an ephemeral
inspiration, and they were thus weaving it away in illuminated letters,
that at least that inspiration might live, though the very weaving
should cost both their lives. So I hastened again to look, and to
listen to the other richer and deeper melody.&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Ah, those days are gone forever;</div>
        <div class="i1">Time has wafted them away;</div>
        <div>Happiness now seems a phantom</div>
        <div class="i1">Of a joyous yesterday.</div>
        <div>If I could but live them over,</div>
        <div class="i1">All those careless, happy hours,</div>
        <div>Start again in life’s fair morning</div>
        <div class="i1">O’er life’s path of thorns and flowers,</div>
        <div>Not a moment would be wasted</div>
        <div class="i1">Chasing bubbles in the air&mdash;</div>
        <div>I would seek the pearls of knowledge,</div>
        <div class="i1">And the gems of wisdom wear.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Could it be that those two spiders were endowed with human faculties,
and that those faculties were now working in unison, inspired by the
same thought, the same feeling? I had little time to meditate this, for
both wrote (I can’t help saying they <i>wrote</i>) as rapidly as slow music
goes, or about as rapidly as I am writing this; and the first spider
had already begun the third stanza.&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Could I live again those days</div>
        <div>That I spent in idle plays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></div>
        <div>And could know of learning’s worth,</div>
        <div>I’d not waste my time in mirth;&mdash;</div>
        <div class="i1">I would climb the hill of fame</div>
        <div>And on wisdom’s wings would soar</div>
        <div class="i1">Till I caught the beacon flame</div>
        <div>In those happy days of yore.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>I then involuntarily turned to the other; but finding that it had
completed a page, as indeed both had done, I removed the finished sheet
of the visible one and at the same instant and by the same act removed
that of the psychologically visible one; though how this latter was
accomplished even psychologists are at their wits’ end to explain. Even
to the close I continued thus to remove the finished sheets as soon as
they were completed. And now from the second I heard.&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Had I known of wisdom’s power</div>
        <div class="i1">In those days with pleasure fraught,</div>
        <div>From the mines of truth and beauty</div>
        <div class="i1">Golden trophies I’d have brought.</div>
        <div>All the lore of bygone ages</div>
        <div class="i1">From my books I would have learned;</div>
        <div>O’er the bards I would have pondered</div>
        <div class="i1">Tho’ my lamp till morning burned;</div>
        <div>All the broad empire of Nature</div>
        <div class="i1">With its wealth of laws divine</div>
        <div>Should have shown to me the beauty</div>
        <div class="i1">Of Omnipotent design.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>While I listened to this, the first spider, apparently conscious of
my abstraction, had waited; but on again bending my eyes in that
direction, again the sad melody floated upwards and away to the
heart-felt words.&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Oh, my heart grows weak and faint,</div>
        <div>And it sighs in sad complaint</div>
        <div>As it dreams its dreams of woe</div>
        <div>Of the silent long ago.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></div>
        <div class="i1">And a pain is at my heart,</div>
        <div>Not alone for wisdom’s lore,</div>
        <div class="i1">For ’twas pierced by sorrow’s dart</div>
        <div>In those happy days of yore.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>What strange tale could this be I was listening to? I turned to the
second weaver of words to mournful melody, and caught the same spirit
in these similar words.&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>I’d have read that revelation</div>
        <div class="i1">Traced by our Creator’s hand</div>
        <div>Over all our glorious planet,</div>
        <div class="i1">In the sky and sea and land.</div>
        <div>High and bright the lamp of knowledge</div>
        <div class="i1">Shone for all who’d seek its light;</div>
        <div>Ah, how oft I scorned to seek it</div>
        <div class="i1">In the glare of pleasures bright!</div>
        <div>Oft upon the dreary mountain</div>
        <div class="i1">Have my weary footsteps strayed:&mdash;</div>
        <div>But ’tis not for wisdom only</div>
        <div class="i1">That my vain regrets are made.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>So! what a train of unutterable sadness the last words of each called
up, suggesting some strange sorrow that must force itself into
expression of sorrowing strains of music, tuned to even sadder words.
Ah yes! to the first, listen!&mdash;</p>

        <div>And within her breast she bore</div>
        <div class="i1">Heart as light and bright and gay</div>
        <div>As those happy days of yore.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Breathlessly I turned to the cadence of the other.&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>In those days of idle dreaming,</div>

        <div>Fancy framed for me an image</div>
        <div class="i1">Of the one I’d woo and win.</div>
        <div>It was in an idle romance</div>
        <div class="i1">My ideal played a part;</div>
        <div>But that image, framed in fancy,</div>
        <div class="i1">Soon was graven on my heart,</div>
        <div>And I said, “That maiden only</div>
        <div class="i1">Of my ideal’s charms complete</div>
        <div>Shall have power to lead me captive</div>
        <div class="i1">And to bring me to her feet.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Ah, ’tis the old, old story that ever sings itself in the human heart,
the story of love. But can it be these spiders are human that they
should thus weave their gold-enlighted words to silver chords of
harmony?</p>

<p>Once more!&mdash;To the first rhythmic weaver, a pleasing recollection.&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>We were playmates, she and I,</div>
        <div>In that happy time gone by:</div>
        <div>Oft we’d walk the meadows over</div>
        <div>Hunting for the four-leaved clover</div>
        <div class="i1">As we’d seen the lovers do;</div>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>And then to the second, the same image, lifting upward and away, above
the clover-blooms and forest-flowers of sweet memory, comes like the
peace of a benediction; and the words weave to quicker though to still
sad notes.&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">

        <div>Time passed on and boyish fancies</div>

        <div class="i1">Every pleasure we embraced.</div>

        <div>Then her pure and gentle spirit</div>
        <div class="i1">Shone abroad like smiles from heaven.&mdash;</div>
        <div>Ah, such divine gifts of beauty</div>
        <div class="i1">Seldom are to mortals given.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>The first one had now finished two pages; the second, three. How
much more they would weave I neither knew nor thought. I was too
much fascinated by the weirdness and reality of it all to think of
anything but the two stories that were being thus wonderfully&mdash;thus
psychologically though not supernaturally&mdash;revealed to me in beauty by
ugly spiders that wrought together; each, I knew, unconscious of the
other. This fact of each being unconscious of the words, thoughts, and
music of the other, and the fact that the web of one was woven into
characters to represent my handwriting, while that of the other was the
illuminated work of my old chum, gave the two songs an interest that no
one else can even approach. No, not even if the same situation should
present itself to him, and the spiders should be actually before him,
as their work, robbed of all these fascinating features, now is.</p>

<p>Both now wove more and more rapidly, and it was only when the first
had woven the following whole page of manuscript that I turned to the
other.&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">

        <div>Fitful Fancy’s dear delight,</div>
        <div>Bringing back the time so bright</div>
        <div class="i1">When we wandered hand in hand</div>
        <div>To the little country store,</div>
        <div class="i1">And the mystic future planned</div>

      <div class="stanza">

        <div>Childhood’s years at last were spent;</div>
        <div>We from friends to lovers grew</div>
        <div>And nor pain nor sorrow knew.</div>
        <div class="i1">Oh how fondly did I dream</div>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Here the sad-voiced dreamer paused a moment, then glided to the
top of the page and waited for me to remove the leaf, while I read
and half aloud chanted from the illuminated page of the other this
master-melody:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>When she came, ’twas like the sunbeam</div>
        <div class="i1">Shedding gladness o’er the lea;</div>
        <div>When she’d gone, ’twas like the ceasing</div>
        <div class="i1">Of enchanting melody.</div>
        <div>Oft when daily tasks were over,</div>
        <div class="i1">She and I together strolled</div>
        <div>From the hamlet to the seaside</div>
        <div class="i1">Where the restless billows rolled.</div>
        <div>Hours and hours we’d wander, gathering</div>
        <div class="i1">Treasures from the shifting sand</div>
        <div>As each ebbing tide receding</div>
        <div class="i1">Left its wonders on the strand.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Long we’d watch the stately vessels</div>
        <div class="i1">Riding proudly o’er the foam,</div>
        <div>Some for distant countries steering,</div>
        <div class="i1">Some returning&mdash;bound for home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></div>
        <div>Then we’d seek the peaceful harbor</div>
        <div class="i1">Where our little sail-boat lay,</div>
        <div>And while skimming o’er the waters</div>
        <div class="i1">Laugh and sing the hours away.</div>
        <div>Then at twilight, when all nature</div>
        <div class="i1">Save the sea was hushed and still,</div>
        <div>We would turn our footsteps homeward</div>
        <div class="i1">To the hamlet on the hill.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>So pleasing was this recollection that I could not yet turn away, but
listened rather than read, as the musician continued on the next page;
for he had finished this, and the harmony continued unbroken.</p>

<p>Just here a sharp pain in my right forefinger interrupted the music,
and reminded me that I had not removed the completed page of the first
harmony-breathing minstrel. I immediately did so, and at once the
billows of subdued music swept through the room to the perfect time of
the weaver’s words in portentous minstrelsy.&mdash;</p>

<p>Here I noticed the striking difference (the only difference throughout
the two poems) between the wishes of the two, both passionately and
beautifully put, and paused a moment to grasp the full meaning. But
only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span> a moment, for I was too interested in this enchanting symphony
to wait longer. Already the poet in spider’s form that was the more
delicate, beautiful, and pathetic was continuing.&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">

        <div class="i1">Not complaining of my lot;</div>

        <div class="i1">And each week a message brought</div>

        <div>Evylyn, it said, was drooping,</div>

        <div>Many months, the message stated,</div>

<p>I found myself so in sympathy with the two spiders&mdash;or poets and
musicians, rather, in spider form&mdash;that I pitied them deeply,
and&mdash;shall I say?&mdash;loved them. The first melodist continued more
mournfully, and to slower, sad, and muffled music.&mdash;</p>

        <div>Came the angels round her bed;</div>
        <div>And they numbered with the dead</div>
        <div class="i1">My angelic, radiant Love</div>

<p>I am not a man who easily gives way to feeling; but the plaintiveness
of the music and the mournfulness of the simple words made me forget
the mysterious bard that was weaving this tale of pathos, and I bowed
my head in sorrow, with my heart full of pity and love for both the
afflicted and the noble-hearted sweet departed. As I did so, the
threnodic notes, as if dying away in the echoing distance of the blue
dome above, thus came from the heart of the other minne-singer.&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">

  </div>

<p>Surely, surely, I thought, these breathers of harmony cannot be ugly
spiders. They are too human&mdash;or shall I say too divine?&mdash;for that. I
had been so absorbed in the two songs that, strange perhaps to say,
though I think not, I had scarcely noticed the spiders themselves nor
their illuminated web-woven words. I felt now that the songs were
nearly ended; and through tear-dimmed eyes, I looked once more at the
page on my desk. How strangely brighter the light seemed to be, yet so
softer!</p>

<p>Could it be possible! Wasn’t this, after all, some dream?&mdash;I dashed the
tears from my eyes with my left hand.&mdash;No, I was wide awake. No doubt
about that. There, too, that light from the words was even brighter
than when it was seen through my tears.</p>

<p>Surely, surely, these were not spiders; but spirits, rather, in this
disguise. As this thought flew through my brain, I removed the fifth
finished page of manuscript, when lo! I almost screamed for mercy that
no more revelations be made to me. For the spider glided to the top of
the new page, and as he did so, I saw and marveled how much smaller
he had grown, as if he had spun his whole body away in his glowing
web. But still stranger transformation: All about him, like a spirit
embodying the body, was a dim halo of light, such as a star often forms
of the mists, that doubtless had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span> been forming from the first although
I had not noticed it, having been too absorbed in the songs themselves.</p>

<p>As I looked steadily, transfixed by this new revelation, I saw that
haloing light, as true as I live, shape itself in a half human form;
and like a light-enhaloed star moving across the scroll of the Almighty
in spheric music set to angel words, this transformed being of light
trembled across the page before me and trailed these gold-enlighted
words through the solemn rhythm of the olden melody.&mdash;</p>

<p>Thoughts of the dead always affect me beyond expression. The thought
of the death of this darling girl, glorious in her own true heart, I
can but feel, and glorified even more by the unfailing constancy and
eternal love of him who, grown old and gray, still keeps her ever in
his heart, so affected me that my own heart seemed almost broken.
I could endure no more, and turned away. But as I did so,&mdash;O sweet
angels of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span> mercy! was there no escape?&mdash;there the other heaven-gifted
musician, spirit-embodied, halo-enshrouded like the first, met my eyes,

        <div>While the tide’s wild song of gladness</div>
        <div class="i1">Seems to bear her voice divine.</div>
        <div>Oft in dreams I see my lost one,</div>
        <div class="i1">Hear her voice as soft and low</div>
        <div>As a strain of far-off music;&mdash;</div>
        <div class="i1">But the dawn brings back my woe.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Bowed with unutterable grief,&mdash;grief that was so severe that it choked
back every tear into my heart,&mdash;I buried my head in my arms to shut
out both sight and sound, and wept as tearless grief alone can weep.
The angel-images of the two that had gone Home, forever to await
the happier marriage in eternal union there, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span> saw looking down
compassionately, while the two mourners left behind were constantly
reaching upwards toward those loved ones beyond their ken in the dim
unknown, and sometimes almost touching the finger-tips of the hands
unseen! Yes; and the music! I heard it over, and over, and over again,
sometimes near, sometimes far, always sweet and tremulous, sometimes
sounding in my ear, sometimes dying away and echoing back from the
dome of that Home above.</p>

<p>When again my fevered eyes looked upon the page, I wondered if it could
be that these embodiments of both verse and music could be changing
so rapidly, or if the change had been going on constantly without my
notice. Both transformed&mdash;I know not now what to call them&mdash;had now
become so small that I could scarcely distinguish their bodies through
the spirit-like halo. And that halo every moment grew more and more
human&mdash;no, not human; but, though an embodying spirit, it grew more and
more like a disembodied human soul. Less and less visible became the
body of each, more and more like a human soul became the halo of each
as the first wove itself away into the final web.&mdash;</p>

        <div>Of the silent long ago.</div>
        <div class="i1">But I’ve reached the river’s brink;</div>
        <div>Soon I’ll dip the golden oar,</div>

      <div class="stanza">

      </div>

    </div>
  </div>

<p>The two spirits, thus transforming, were passing away, slipping,
slipping away from me back into the mysteriousness whence they came, I
felt, as both moved across the page to dirge-like yet a kind of happy
and hope-inspiring music. The music of each was so blended with that of
the other that I could scarcely distinguish the words of the two as the
second soul-dreamer mused through the melody.&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Lost! ah lost!&mdash;But not forever:</div>

        <div class="i1">We will wander hand in hand;</div>
        <div>Soon across the deep, dark waters</div>
        <div class="i1">I will go to claim my own</div>

        <div class="i1">In that bright eternal home.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>But look&mdash;look!&mdash;there, there just before you. See! see it struggling
to rise away. Oh, what wonderful transformation can this be!</p>

<p>As both neared the close, their bodies grew imperceptible, the
web-woven words more and more brightly illuminated, and the haloing
spirit larger, and larger, more and more distinct, yet more and more
attenuated, until&mdash;no, no! it&mdash;but yes! I must believe it, must believe
my eyes!&mdash;each took on the form of an angel! As the last word of each
was woven, simultaneously, and as the low, faint, plaintive echoes of
the music went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span> trembling through the blue distance that still trembles
in unison with the hearts of millions, the two <i>meistersingers</i>,
perfect in angel form with a rarer beauty than I ever saw before, the
rarest beauty I ever expect to see, shone radiantly in the night for a
moment, like a glory struck out of darkness by a beam from heaven, and
vanished like that glory passing out of darkness into heaven again.
With my eyes following these disembodied embodiments of Beauty, and my
palms out-reaching toward them, thus I sat until, when their passing
glory at the same time closed the portals through which they vanished
and gave the keys to memory, my nerves relaxed, the intense mingled
pain and rapture, which had never ceased, seemed to snap my very
heart-chords, and consciousness slid like lead into the lethean flow of
the river of oblivion.</p>

<p>How long I sat there, drowned in unrefreshing forgetfulness allied
to sleep, I have no recollection, and no possible means of knowing.
When again I opened my eyes, the morning was far spent. There was a
dull pain in my head, but the circumstances I have just related were
all so vivid that the whole scene instantly flashed across my mind. I
thought surely it must be a dream. Could it be? I was sitting in my
night-dress. I got up from my chair and went to my bed-room. There was
my bed, just as I had left it when I rose to follow the strange spirit
that controlled me. I went to the wall where I had seen the spider.
True enough, there was the thread, but no longer illuminated, just
where I had seen it. I put my hand to my forehead as one often does in
wondering. When I removed it, there, clinging to my forefinger, was
the web that had clung to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span> forehead. No, I had not been asleep and
dreamed all this; that was plain enough. I returned to my chair. There
on my desk, as I involuntarily glanced at the well-remembered spot, I
saw a still more remarkable confirmation of my having been awake; for
there lay the whole poem that I had seen woven by the first spirit, as
perfect in every way as if it had been written by human hand. But the
characters were no longer illuminated. They had burnt into the paper,
and were as black as my own ink. They were all made out, too, in my
own style of handwriting, though I declare and affirm to all the world
that never before this occurrence had I written one line of poetry.
Perhaps it would have been better for me and for you if I had stopped
with this&mdash;palmed it off as my own on account of the similarity of
handwriting; and if I had never trifled with the tricks of the muses
thereafter.</p>

<p>I looked on my desk for the other poem, but alas! it could not be
found; for, as I have said before, it was only <i>psychologically</i>
present to me, while it was <i>really</i> present to some one else. In a
few days I had the most remarkable confirmation of this&mdash;even more
remarkable than what I have related in the preceding.</p>

<p>By the very next mail (I was teaching in the country and got my mail
but once a week, on Saturday) I received a letter from my old chum,
dated May 8, 1885. As I opened it, behold! that identical poem that I
had in my mind seen wrought by the second spirit of beauty fell on my
table. In a letter of sixteen quarto pages, he told one substantially
the same experience of himself with two spirit-singers&mdash;one of them
present, the other psychologically present, each unconscious of the
other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span> yet each influencing the other in some indefinable way&mdash;as I
have here related.</p>

<p>In speaking of the vanishing of the two spirit-forms, he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I firmly believe those two spirits were none other than the
angel-forms of the two maidens the poems celebrate; that they have
woven their spirits of beauty into these two embodiments of verse that
we mortals may be the better for it; and that, when they vanished, they
entered these two poems, where they still abide.”</p>

<p>Strange, but this is the same thought that I had had, and still do
have. I most sincerely believe it is the only correct conclusion,
though I cannot solve the mysteries that are connected with it. Indeed,
it would be sacrilege to attempt it.</p>

<p>I still have these original manuscripts that were thus mysteriously
wrought. They are lying here on the desk before me as I write; and as
I glance across this page at them, the whole scene of that memorable
night, more vivid, far, far more vivid than my pen has delineated it
for you, comes flashing across my brain. In this quick, bright light
of memory, reason marshals the long line of causes that produced this
psychological phenomenon; I follow the approaching lines with my
mind’s eye, until I am lost in the dim distance of their vanishing
perspective, then return, follow again, only to lose myself in the same
unfathomable mystery, and so again and again. Though I know some of
the causes that produced it, I cannot reach the hidden ones. I could
almost fancy still that I had dreamed all this did not these original
manuscripts before me constantly remind me of the reality of what I
have here set down. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span> are free for the inspection of all who wish
to verify the facts I have related.</p>

<p>I challenge the world to produce two such similar poems, good, bad, or
indifferent, written under such remarkable circumstances.</p>

<p>The events I have here recorded are the events of my boyhood, or early
manhood, rather, faithfully told. I have long hesitated to publish them
for fear that there might be a few in these days of fiction who would
doubt their reality. But what makes them a hundredfold more wonderful
to me is the truth of all their seemingly impossible facts.</p>

<p>My friend, you think this a strange, strange story, I know. Indeed,
I think so too; far more strange to me than to you, for I have felt
the truth of it and you have only read it. As true as these two poems
exist, the circumstances under which they were written are far, far
more strange to me than I can possibly make the story; far, far more
strange to me than the weirdest, most wonderful story pen can write.</p>

<p>I have therefore published this account of an incident of my life
that it may please some with the strange facts that they will take
for mere fancy; that it may waken some to the knowledge that in our
most rational moments we are by no means independent, our minds are
by no means our own, but are influenced by circumstances, by the
psychological action of the minds of our most intimate friends, and
by the spiritual power within us and at the same time above us; that
it may teach others that out of the most despised creatures of God’s
making and care, the Soul of Beauty may come and wed itself to Use by
weaving its life into an angel-image of Love that shall dwell in the
human heart forever.</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of

States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
